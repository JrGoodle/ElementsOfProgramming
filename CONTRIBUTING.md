I can't make any promises on timely review and acceptance of pull requests at this point. I started having a bit too much fun porting the original C++ code to Swift, so I've only rigorously worked through a small portion along with the book so far. I can't say how long it will take me; so If any pull requests are submitted for areas I haven't worked through yet, it may be a bit of a wait on the review (but it could be a good motivator for me :)
